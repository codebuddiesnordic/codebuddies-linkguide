Say goodbye to ugly <select>. 
CSS now gives you full control.

For years, <select> elements have been frustrating to style. 
Often needing JavaScript or UI libraries. 
Now, modern browsers bring full customization to native dropdowns.

What’s New?
Chrome introduces new CSS properties for better <select> styling. 
No more browser inconsistencies!

1 - Total Style Control
Customize backgrounds, borders, and padding without hacks.

2 - Custom Dropdowns
Control width, height, and animations. 
No more default system styles.

3 - Multi-Column & Scrollable Options
Create advanced layouts, scrolling areas, and better positioning.


Why It Matters?
- Dropdowns match your design system without breaking accessibility.
- Native UI is lighter and quicker.
- No need for extra libraries nor JavaScript.

Rolling out in Chrome 135+, with other browsers likely to follow. 
Start experimenting today!

This will finally end painful <select> styling 🔥
